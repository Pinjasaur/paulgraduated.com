        during my time there (2019). Kristoff&apos;s Subaru Legacy on the left
        and my <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/re7gGq2W2mg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subaru Outback</a>

        Keeping with the autumn theme: Michigan Tech&apos;s trails. Taken fall
        2018 featuring my 1998 Gary Fisher Joshua Z0 I bought off Kristoff for
        $300. Not pictured: my friend who foolishly ran too low tire pressure
        and flatted up the trail.
