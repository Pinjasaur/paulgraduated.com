    <h1>Hi there.</h1>
    <p>Glad to see you made it.</p>
    <!-- <p>
      I'm <a href="https://paulisaweso.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul</a>
      and this a little site providing additional details during my time through
      undergrad.

    <p>
      I met some cool people during undergrad. Shoutout to Kristoff, Gary, Parker,
      &amp; Richy for providing photos. Credited where&nbsp;applicable.
    </p>
    <p>Without further ado, let&apos;s get started.</p>

        Keeping with the autumn theme: Michigan Tech&apos;s trails. Taken fall
        2018 featuring my 1998 Gary Fisher Joshua Z0 I bought off Kristoff for
        $300. Not pictured: my friend who foolishly ran too low tire pressure
        and flatted up the trail.

        Ah, here&apos;s an excellent one. Parker came to visit during my last
        semester so we (me, Kristoff, and Parker) made smash burgers. Potato buns,
        carmelized onions, a mix of potato and sweet potato fries coupled with
        80/20 ground beef (or Beyond&trade; patties) is a recipe for success.
        Not pictured: lots of smoke that really should&apos;ve set off the alarms.

        See, I <em>told you</em> I use the bike rack. Kristoff &amp; I picked up
        rental fat bikes in Calumet, MI to go riding at the nearby Swedetown
        trails.
